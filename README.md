# Sarcasm Detection on Reddit Comments

This project is all about detecting sarcasm in Reddit commentsâ€”a tricky but interesting challenge! 

We started by building a model using a Bi-Directional LSTM, which managed to detect sarcasm with about 85% accuracy. To make it even better, we introduced BERT, which boosted the model's performance by 70%, especially in recognizing sarcasm in political and darker-themed comments.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NLP**
- **Bi-Directional LSTM**
- **BERT**
- **Preprocessing**

The project was a great way to explore sarcasm detection and push the boundaries of what our models can understand! :)
